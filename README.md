# React Native Authentication with Context Api

This repository is an example of authentication using Context API in react native. The example covers 3 screens(Login, Signup, and Home). You can navigate between screens and log in to see the home page which requires authentication. You will need an account to log in and can create a new one through sign-up screen. 

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mbozkaya/react-native-authentication-context-api.git
$ cd react-native-authentication-context-api/app/
$ npm install
$ expo install
$ expo start
```

Now you can reach out to the application through the Expo app you used on your phone.
